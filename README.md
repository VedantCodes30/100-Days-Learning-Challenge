# 100-Days-Learning-Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days Coding Challenge repository! This project is all about improving my coding skills and building a strong coding habit over the course of 100 days.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days Coding Challenge is a personal coding journey where I commit to coding every day for the next 100 days. The primary goals of this challenge are:

- Learn Frontend Development 
- Learn UI/UX Design Using Figma

I will be working on a variety of coding tasks, projects, and exercises to achieve these goals.

## Progress

You can track my daily progress on Github repo and Instagram Page. I'll be updating it regularly to document my journey, what I've learned, and any challenges I've faced.
